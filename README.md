## Description
Chiron is an application created with patient and physician interaction in mind. The application has a user authentication system that allows patients to sign up or login and view their patient portal.
Upon signup, the patient will create their login credentials, input contact information, patient history, and give information on lifestyle choices regarding drugs/alcohol. This information is then populated into the patient portal, Chiron Portal.
Within the portal, the patient has the ability to schedule an appointment and is taken to a list of doctors to select the doctor they would like to see.
